Create interactive slides for Machine Learning models. 

There are two notebooks available:
- one nootebook to train Random Forest on Iris dataset
- one notebook to predict Iris species - it is served as online presentation. You can select sample values during presentation and compute the prediction in the slides! ðŸ˜Ž

The app is available online, deployed at Heroku https://ml-model-presentation.herokuapp.com/

The website and slides are created with [Mercury](https://github.com/mljar/mercury) framework.
